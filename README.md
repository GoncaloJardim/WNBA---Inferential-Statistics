# WNBA---Inferential-Statistics
Mini Project regarding insights about WNBA. 

A project where I had to clean data, understand the characteristics of the datasets, and extract good insights of the data to reply to the given questions.

In this project it can be showed my Data Cleaning capabilities, as well as using Data Visualization libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn to improve the analysis.
After cleaning and visualizing I did inferential statistics in order to test some hypotesis and understand the Confidence Intervals.
